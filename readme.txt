	Lahti 19.1.2002


In this package you will find the sources for the ESKIMO fishing trip game.
The game should be buidable with Visual C++ version 6.0. Additionally you'll need
the Intel JPEG Library (I used version 1.1) <http://www.intel.com> and
FMOD <http://www.fmod.org>.

The source code is all licensed under the terms of the Lesser GPL
(GNU Lesser General Public License). See license.txt.
